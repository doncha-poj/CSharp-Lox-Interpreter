# A Lox Interpreter Written in C#
This was made for my class to create a lox interpreter using this textbook: https://craftinginterpreters.com/

Any language could be chosen to write this interpreter (with the exception of Java because the website uses that language)

It's encouraged to use a langauge you do not know to write this; I used C#.

(Note: This was created with the help of copilot within Visual Studio)
